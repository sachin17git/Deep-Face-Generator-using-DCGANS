# Deep-Face-Generator-using-DCGANS
#### Generating new faces and comparing them with original faces using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks.
#### Implemented in PyTorch.
The dataset for this model was taken from Kaggle. Link - https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset
This model was trained for several epochs on dedicated GPU. The more you train higher will be the accuracy.
#### Here are the sample generated images for different epochs.
#### For higher Epochs the model will produce more realistic images.
### Epoch 10


### Epoch 25
