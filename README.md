# Deep-Face-Generator-using-DCGANS
#### Generating new faces and comparing them with original faces using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks.
#### Implemented in PyTorch.
The dataset for this model was taken from Kaggle. Link - https://www.kaggle.com/jessicali9530/celeba-dataset. 

This model was trained for several epochs on dedicated GPU. The more you train higher will be the accuracy.
### Sample Training Images

### Here are the generated faces for different epochs.
### For higher Epochs the model will produce more realistic images.
### Epoch 25
